# Privacy Policy for SelectorPass

**Last updated: November 9, 2025**

## Data Collection and Storage

SelectorPass is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **Local Storage Only**: All your data (domains, credentials, settings) is stored locally on your device using Chrome's local storage API
- **No Cloud Sync**: We do not sync, upload, or transmit your data to any external servers
- **No Analytics**: We do not collect usage analytics, tracking data, or personal information
- **No Third-Party Services**: The extension operates entirely offline except for the optional "Buy Me a Coffee" link

## Data We Store Locally

- Domain configurations (website URLs and CSS selectors)
- Credentials (usernames and passwords) stored in plain text
- User preferences and settings
- UI state (collapsed/expanded sections)

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Website content
- Usage patterns
- Device information
- Location data

## Permissions Used

- **Storage**: To save your configurations and credentials locally
- **ActiveTab**: To fill forms on the current tab only when you explicitly request it

## Data Security

- All data remains on your local device
- No network transmission of any data whatsoever
- Extension operates completely offline (except for optional Buy Me a Coffee link)
- Standard Chrome extension security model applies
